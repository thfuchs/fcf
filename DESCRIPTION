Package: tsRNN
Title: Time Series Forecasting using Recurrent Neural Networks by Keras
Version: 0.2.0
Authors@R: person("Thomas", "Fuchs", email = "thomasfuchs-re@web.de", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: `tsRNN` tries to provide a ready-to-use time series forecasting suite
    for recurrent neural networks. The package is enhanced by basic implementations
    of "simple" algorithms like ARIMA for comparison and provides accuracy 
    measures as well as basic chart options for model comparisons.  
    Note that `tsRNN` heavily depends on Keras and the TensorFlow Deep Learning 
    framework.
